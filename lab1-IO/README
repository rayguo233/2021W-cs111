Some Comments
    I haven't figured out any clever way to seperate
    output from the shell program to the server into
    batches. So I just grouped any continuous stream of
    bytes from the shell to the server as a batch, and
    then compress that batch and send over to the user.
    There might be cases where the output of one command
    get sent to the server in several batches.

    In the case of the client side script, I seperate batches
    by the user's '\n' input.

    I haven't got anything that handles fprintf() error,
    because I use fprintf() in error handling...
